# ðŸ”’ Mosswood Security Implementation Guide

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

Your Supabase security audit identified **3 ERRORS**, **6 WARNINGS**, and **2 INFO items** that have been systematically addressed with comprehensive SQL scripts.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enable RLS and Create Policies
Run `security_fixes.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

**What this fixes:**
- âœ… Enables RLS on all public tables (profiles, followers, videos, purchases, etc.)
- âœ… Creates comprehensive RLS policies for proper access control
- âœ… Implements stealth mode for master_admin accounts
- âœ… Protects sensitive financial data in purchases table

### Step 2: Fix Function Security  
Run `function_security_fixes.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

**What this fixes:**
- âœ… Sets proper search paths for all database functions
- âœ… Makes functions SECURITY DEFINER for better isolation
- âœ… Recreates triggers with secure function calls
- âœ… Adds proper audit logging capabilities

### Step 3: Configure Auth Settings
Run `auth_security_fixes.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

**What this fixes:**
- âœ… Creates admin_audit_log and platform_settings tables
- âœ… Implements comprehensive audit logging system
- âœ… Sets up proper RLS policies for admin features

### Step 4: Dashboard Configuration
**Manual steps in Supabase Dashboard:**

1. **Go to Authentication > Settings**
2. **Set OTP Expiry:**
   - Email OTP expiry: 3600 seconds (1 hour) or less
   - SMS OTP expiry: 600 seconds (10 minutes) or less
3. **Enable Leaked Password Protection:**
   - Check "Breached password protection" box

### Step 5: Verify Implementation
Run `test_security_fixes.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to verify all fixes are working correctly.

## ðŸ”§ What Each Script Does

### security_fixes.sql
- **Profiles Table**: Users can view public profiles, update only their own
- **Videos Table**: Public viewing, creators manage their own content
- **Purchases Table**: Users see only their purchases, creators see their sales
- **Followers Table**: Public follow relationships, users manage their own follows
- **Analytics Tables**: Creators see their own data, admins see everything

### function_security_fixes.sql
- **handle_new_user**: Creates profiles securely when users sign up
- **update_updated_at_column**: Updates timestamps with proper isolation
- **update_daily_analytics**: Aggregates view data securely
- **handle_user_login**: Tracks login events with audit logging

### auth_security_fixes.sql  
- **Admin Audit Log**: Tracks all administrative actions
- **Platform Settings**: Secure configuration management
- **Audit Functions**: Automatic logging of sensitive operations

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Implementation

After running all scripts, the test file will verify:

- âœ… RLS is enabled on all critical tables
- âœ… Proper policies are created and active
- âœ… Functions have secure configurations
- âœ… Admin stealth mode is working
- âœ… Audit logging is functional

## ðŸš¨ Critical Notes

1. **Backup First**: Always backup your database before running these scripts
2. **Test Environment**: Consider testing on a staging database first
3. **Service Role**: These scripts require service role permissions in Supabase
4. **Application Impact**: Your application uses service keys, so RLS policies shouldn't break existing functionality
5. **Monitor Logs**: Watch your application logs after implementation for any access issues

## ðŸ”„ Application Compatibility

Your Mosswood application should continue working normally because:
- Server-side code uses service role keys (bypasses RLS for admin operations)
- Client-side operations go through your server API (proper user context)
- All existing access patterns are preserved in the RLS policies
- Admin functions maintain full access for management operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After implementation, your Supabase Security Advisor should show:
- **0 ERRORS** (all RLS issues resolved)
- **Significantly fewer WARNINGS** (function security fixed)
- **Proper INFO status** (admin tables have policies)

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues during implementation:
1. Check the verification queries in `test_security_fixes.sql`
2. Review application logs for RLS policy violations
3. Ensure all scripts were run with proper permissions

Your database will be significantly more secure while maintaining full application functionality!
