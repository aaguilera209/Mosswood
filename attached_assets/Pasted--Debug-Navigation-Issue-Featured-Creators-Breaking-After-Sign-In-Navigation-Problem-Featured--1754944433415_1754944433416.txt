# Debug Navigation Issue - Featured Creators Breaking After Sign In Navigation

## Problem
Featured Creators loads correctly on initial homepage visit, but gets stuck in "Loading creators..." state when navigating back from sign-in page using browser back button.

## Root Cause Analysis Needed

### 1. Check if Home component is remounting unnecessarily
Add this debugging code to `Home.tsx` at the top of the component:

```javascript
// Add this right after the imports in Home.tsx
console.log('Home component rendered at:', new Date().toISOString());

// Add this inside the Home component, right after the useState/useQuery declarations
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Home component mounted/updated');
  return () => {
    console.log('Home component unmounting');
  };
}, []);
```

### 2. Check authentication state interference
Look for any authentication-related useEffect or query invalidation that might be running on navigation. Check:

- Is there any auth state change detection in `Home.tsx`?
- Are there any `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` calls related to auth changes?
- Is the user authentication state changing during navigation?

### 3. Check React Router setup
Verify the routing configuration:
- Is the Home route wrapped in any authentication guards?
- Are there any route-level useEffect hooks that might interfere?
- Is the Home component being conditionally rendered based on auth state?

### 4. Add navigation debugging
Add this to track navigation behavior:

```javascript
// In Home.tsx, add this useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Current pathname:', location.pathname);
  console.log('Creators loading state:', creatorsLoading);
  console.log('Creators data length:', creators?.length);
  console.log('Error state:', error);
}, [location.pathname, creatorsLoading, creators, error]);
```

### 5. Check for QueryClient configuration issues
Look for any `queryClient` configuration that might be affecting navigation:
- Default stale time settings
- Query invalidation on focus/mount
- Any global query defaults that might interfere

### 6. Temporary fix: Force refetch on navigation
As a temporary workaround, try adding this to the Home component:

```javascript
// Add this useEffect to force refetch when coming back to homepage
useEffect(() => {
  if (location.pathname === '/' && creators.length === 0 && !creatorsLoading) {
    console.log('Forcing creators refetch due to navigation');
    // If using React Query, you can use refetch from the useQuery
    // refetch();
  }
}, [location.pathname]);
```

## Investigation Steps
1. Add the debugging code above
2. Test the navigation flow: Homepage → Sign In → Back button
3. Check browser console for the debug messages
4. Look for any patterns in when the component mounts/unmounts
5. Check if there are any auth-related query invalidations happening

## Expected Findings
The debugging should reveal:
- Whether the Home component is unmounting/remounting unnecessarily
- If auth state changes are affecting the query
- If there are any route-level interference issues
- The exact point where the creators data gets lost

## Files to Check
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` (add debugging)
- Your main router configuration file
- Any authentication context/providers
- QueryClient setup/configuration
