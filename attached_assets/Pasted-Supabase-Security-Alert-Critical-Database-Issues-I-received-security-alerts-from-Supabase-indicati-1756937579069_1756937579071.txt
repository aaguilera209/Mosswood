Supabase Security Alert - Critical Database Issues
I received security alerts from Supabase indicating critical errors in my Project Mosswood database that require immediate attention. The issues are related to Row Level Security (RLS) policies on public tables. I need your help to systematically investigate, fix, and thoroughly test these security vulnerabilities.
Current Issues Identified:
ERRORS (3 total):

RLS Disabled on Public Tables - Multiple public tables have Row Level Security disabled, which could result in unauthorized database access:

public.users
public.creators
public.followers



WARNINGS (6 total):

Function Search Path Mutable - Multiple functions have mutable search paths that are not set:

public.handle_new_user
public.update_updated_at_column
public.update_daily_analytics
public.handle_user_login


Auth OTP Long Expiry - OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
Leaked Password Protection Disabled - Password protection is currently disabled

INFO/SUGGESTIONS (2 total):

RLS Enabled No Policy - Tables with RLS enabled but no policies created:

public.admin_audit_log
public.platform_settings



Required Actions:

Immediate Security Fixes:

Enable RLS on all public tables (users, creators, followers)
Create appropriate RLS policies for each table based on our application's access patterns
Review and implement proper policies for admin_audit_log and platform_settings tables


Function Security:

Set proper search paths for all identified functions
Ensure functions are using appropriate security definer settings
Review function permissions and access controls


Authentication Security:

Review and adjust OTP expiry settings to recommended values
Enable leaked password protection


Testing Requirements:

After implementing fixes, create comprehensive tests for:

Each RLS policy to ensure proper access control
Function execution with different user roles
Authentication flows with new security settings


Test unauthorized access attempts
Verify that legitimate users can still perform required operations


Documentation:

Document all changes made
Create a security policy reference for future development
Note any application code changes required due to new policies



Additional Context:

Database ID: kdtjkbgnntdtclzrbphd
This is a production database, so please be careful with migrations
Ensure backward compatibility where possible
If breaking changes are necessary, provide a migration strategy

Please start by analyzing the current database schema and existing policies (if any), then proceed with implementing the fixes in a systematic manner. Prioritize the ERRORS first, followed by WARNINGS, then INFO items. After each change, verify that the application functionality remains intact.
Provide regular updates on progress and any potential impacts to the application functionality. If you encounter any issues that might affect production users, alert me before proceeding.
