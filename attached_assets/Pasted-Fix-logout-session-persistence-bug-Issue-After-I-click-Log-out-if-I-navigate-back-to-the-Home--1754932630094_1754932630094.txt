Fix logout/session persistence bug

Issue
- After I click “Log out,” if I navigate back to the Home page (Welcome to Mosswood + Featured Creators) or any page, I am still shown as logged in. Expected: once logged out, I should be treated as logged out everywhere (no user in header, no creator-only controls, protected routes blocked).

Stack context
- Supabase Auth (email/password)
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Router (Wouter or similar)
- TanStack Query (likely)
- We have a Header/UserMenu and role-based UI

What to implement
1) Ensure proper sign out
   - Use `await supabase.auth.signOut()`
   - Immediately clear all local user state (e.g., auth context) and role in memory.
   - Invalidate/remove any persisted session keys (localStorage/sessionStorage) that might shadow Supabase state.

2) Centralize auth state
   - In `supabase.ts` or auth provider, add a single source of truth for the current user.
   - Subscribe to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` and propagate changes to the app (context or query cache).
   - When event is `SIGNED_OUT`, reset user context and invalidate relevant queries: `['me']`, `['profile']`, `['purchases']`, etc.

3) Header + UI refresh
   - Header/UserMenu should derive user from the centralized auth context (not stale props).
   - After logout, header must immediately rerender to “Sign in / Sign up” state.
   - Remove any optimistic “user cached” code that ignores auth state changes.

4) Route protection & redirects
   - Creator-only routes (e.g., /dashboard) and viewer-only private pages must guard on auth context.
   - On logout, if the user is on a protected page, redirect to `/` or `/login`.
   - Public pages must not fetch private data for a logged-out user.

5) Cache + storage hygiene
   - If we use TanStack Query, `queryClient.clear()` or invalidate user-related keys on logout.
   - Remove any manual `localStorage` flags that imply logged-in (e.g., `isCreator`, `role`).
   - Ensure no “remember me” shim bypasses Supabase session logic.

6) Test plan (please verify)
   - Log in → header shows display name and proper menu.
   - Click “Log out”:
     • Header immediately shows “Sign in / Sign up”.
     • Visiting Home or refreshing the page still shows logged-out state.
     • Navigating to /dashboard while logged out redirects to /login (or /).
   - Log back in → state updates everywhere without hard refresh.

Deliverables
- Patch to auth provider and header to rely on a single auth context.
- Correct `signOut` handler that clears session, cache, and reroutes if needed.
- Route guards updated to respect auth context.
- Brief note in PR explaining what local storage keys were removed/changed and which queries are invalidated.
