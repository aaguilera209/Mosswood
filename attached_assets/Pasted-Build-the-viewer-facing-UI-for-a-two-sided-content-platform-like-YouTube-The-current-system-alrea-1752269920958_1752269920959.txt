Build the viewer-facing UI for a two-sided content platform (like YouTube). The current system already supports creators with dashboards and upload flows. This prompt focuses on building the interface and experience for the “viewer” role.

🧑‍💻 ROLE CONTEXT:
Viewers are regular users who browse creator storefronts, watch video trailers, and purchase full videos via Stripe. Their experience should feel clean, focused, and user-first.

🎯 OBJECTIVES:

1. 🏠 **Viewer Homepage**
   - Create a simple landing page that shows a welcome message and a few suggested creators
   - Include login/signup buttons (if not logged in)
   - If logged in, greet by name and provide quick links to:
     - My Library (purchased videos)
     - Explore Creators

2. 🛍️ **Creator Shop Page (Viewer View)**
   - Show a creator’s storefront (already exists — confirm it’s viewer-safe)
   - Hide any creator-only controls like "Edit" or "Upload"
   - If viewer has already purchased a video, show it as unlocked
   - If not, display price + “Buy & Watch” button

3. 🎥 **Video Detail Page**
   - Consistent with viewer context:
     - If purchased → Show video player (unlocked)
     - If not purchased → Show locked state and Stripe purchase modal
     - If not logged in → Prompt to log in before purchase
   - Add a “Back to Creator Page” link for easy navigation

4. 🧭 **Viewer Navigation Header**
   - Remove or hide creator-only items like Dashboard or Upload
   - Header should include:
     - Explore
     - My Library
     - Profile icon / dropdown (Logout, Settings)
   - Optional: add dark mode toggle if not already included

5. 📚 **My Library Page**
   - Page that lists all purchased videos for the logged-in viewer
   - Each item links to the video detail page

6. 🔐 **Access Control**
   - Viewer should never see creator-only UI
   - Creator should never see purchase buttons on their own content

7. ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
   - Make sure viewer UI works only for users with role = “viewer” from Supabase
   - Fallback gracefully if user is not logged in

Use existing styles and page structure where possible. Keep the UX clean and modern.
