Prompt: Improve Profile Form UX – Input Styling, Keyboard Behavior, and Social Link Handling

🛠️ Goal:
Enhance the UX of the profile form across three areas:
1. Fix broken text selection shortcuts
2. Improve visual styling of focused input fields
3. Rethink social link input UX to prevent misuse or clutter

---

🧠 1. Keyboard UX Fixes
Currently, users cannot use standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Cmd+Shift+← or →) to highlight text inside input and textarea fields on the profile form. This breaks a common editing behavior expected on desktop.

✅ Expected Fix:
- Allow standard text editing shortcuts:
  - Cmd+← and Cmd+→: Move to beginning/end of line
  - Cmd+Shift+← / →: Select to beginning/end of line
  - Cmd+A: Select all
  - Shift+← / →: Character-level selection
- Should work in both `<input>` and `<textarea>` fields across browsers (Mac + Windows)

🎨 2. Green Focus Border – Replace or Remove
Right now, when focusing any profile field (e.g. Website), a green border appears. This:
- Looks visually harsh
- Sometimes overlaps or obstructs icons/text (see attached screenshot)

✅ Desired Change:
- Remove the current green focus ring
- Replace with a cleaner, more modern highlight (e.g. subtle box shadow or border-bottom underline)
- Ensure icons inside fields are not obstructed by styling

---

🔗 3. Social Links Input UX
Right now, social links are presented as hard-coded fields (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc), which:
- Forces a fixed format (could be misused by user pasting wrong platform)
- Doesn’t scale or allow flexibility

💡 Better UX Proposal:
- Change to a dynamic list of link fields:
  - User can input multiple links (1 per field)
  - Each link auto-detects the platform based on the URL (e.g. youtube.com → YouTube, instagram.com → Instagram)
  - Option to add/remove fields dynamically
  - Frontend shows a platform-specific icon or label next to each link

Let me know which approach you'd recommend for #3 — or go ahead and prototype the smart auto-detect system if feasible. Prioritize fixing #1 and #2 first.
