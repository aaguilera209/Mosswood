Build a responsive Creator Storefront page in React using TailwindCSS. This is a public-facing profile page for a content creator where fans can browse and purchase their videos.

1. Set up a new component (CreatorStorefront.jsx) and route (/creator/:username).

2. Page layout:
- Full-width hero banner image (placeholder URL is fine)
- Centered creator name over the banner
- Circular avatar that overlaps the banner bottom
- Follow or Subscribe button
- Optional social media icons: Twitter, IG, YouTube

3. Creator bio section:
- Short paragraph-style bio beneath avatar
- Optional tags like location, creator type (e.g. filmmaker, fitness instructor), or tagline

4. Video grid (main content area):
- Display videos in a responsive 3-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, 1-column on mobile
- Each video card should include:
  - Thumbnail (placeholder okay)
  - Video title
  - Duration (e.g. "12:34")
  - Pricing logic:
    - If price > 0, show "$X.XX" and button “Buy” or “Rent”
    - If price === 0, show “Free” and button “Watch Now”

5. Footer:
- Basic footer with "Powered by Mosswood"
- Add placeholder links: Terms | Privacy | Explore Creators

6. Styling:
- Use TailwindCSS with dark theme: bg-black text-white and amber accents
- Add subtle hover effects to buttons and cards (hover:scale, hover:opacity)
- Use rounded corners and drop shadows on cards

7. No filters or sorting controls yet — keep it clean and focused

8. Use dummy data for the creator and their videos:
const creator = {
  name: "Maya Lee",
  avatar: "https://placehold.co/100x100",
  banner: "https://placehold.co/1200x400",
  bio: "Documentarian and digital storyteller. Sharing human stories through raw lenses.",
  socialLinks: {
    twitter: "#",
    youtube: "#",
    website: "#"
  }
};

const videos = [
  {
    title: "How I Shot This Scene",
    duration: "12:34",
    price: 9.99,
    thumbnail: "https://placehold.co/400x200"
  },
  {
    title: "My Creative Process",
    duration: "08:15",
    price: 0,
    thumbnail: "https://placehold.co/400x200"
  },
  {
    title: "Documentary BTS",
    duration: "15:22",
    price: 4.99,
    thumbnail: "https://placehold.co/400x200"
  }
];

Keep it modular and clean. No backend logic or auth required yet.
