ðŸš€ GOAL:
Implement full profile customization for both creators and viewers on Mosswood, starting with an MVP version that allows users to edit and display essential profile information.

ðŸ”§ CONTEXT:
We want to create clean, editable profiles that feel professional and personal. This profile will appear on Creator Storefronts and optionally in Viewer Libraries in the future.

ðŸ§± MVP PROFILE FIELDS (build all of these now):
- Display Name (real name or stage name)
- Tagline / One-liner (a short hook under the name)
- Bio (a few lines max â€” optional to fill out, but field must exist)
- Location (city/state or country)
- Time Zone (standard list of time zones)
- Avatar Upload (JPEG or PNG, displayed in a circle)
- Website (creator's main link)
- Social Links (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.)
- Contact Email

ðŸ“‹ INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Database Update**: Add the above fields to the `profiles` table using a migration. Fields like social links can be stored as an array or JSON blob for flexibility.

2. **Edit Profile Page**:
   - Build a `/edit-profile` route available to both creators and viewers (but only accessible when logged in).
   - Create a simple form that includes all MVP fields.
   - Pre-fill fields using current user profile data from Supabase.
   - Save form updates back to Supabase on submit.

3. **Public Profile Display**:
   - Update Creator Storefront pages to display all public profile info:
     - Display Name
     - Tagline
     - Bio
     - Avatar
     - Website + Socials
     - Location (optional to show)
   - Add a basic visual layout â€” prioritize clarity over flashiness for now.

4. **UX Notes**:
   - For avatars, show default placeholder if none is uploaded.
   - For social links, use recognizable icons (if easy).
   - For timezone and location, defaults are fine if data is missing.
   - Form validation should be basic â€” just confirm valid URLs/emails where needed.

âœ… DO NOT include birthday, pronouns, phone number, or Stripe info.

Once MVP is live, weâ€™ll revisit optional profile enhancements like banner image, content categories, preferred language, etc.

Let me know once you've created the edit page and updated the schema, and Iâ€™ll test it from the Creator Dashboard!
